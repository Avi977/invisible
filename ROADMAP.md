# Roadmap

The phased plan to move `invisible` from "rich CLI scaffolding" to "shipped
Windows desktop app with a unified VPS connection". Each phase ends with a
concrete shippable artifact and an updated `CHANGELOG.md`.

---

## Phase 0 — Repo bootstrap [in progress]

- [x] `git init`, public GitHub repo
- [x] `.gitignore`, `.env.example`, `invisible.toml.example`
- [x] `README.md` + `CHANGELOG.md` + `ROADMAP.md`
- [x] Conventional-commits changelog generator + pre-push hook
- [ ] CI: lint + import-smoke on push (GitHub Actions)
- [ ] `invisible-doctor` green on a fresh clone

**Exit criteria:** a teammate (or a fresh laptop) can `git clone` and reach a
working `invisible-doctor` in under 5 minutes.

---

## Phase 1 — Operational baseline

Prove the existing scaffolding actually runs end-to-end.

- [ ] First orchestrator run: `invisible-review jobslayer` until approved
- [ ] Checkpoint round-trip: run, kill mid-iteration, `--resume` cleanly
- [ ] Notion sync writes a real run row
- [ ] Telegram alerts fire on cap-hit + approval
- [ ] Logs land in `~/.invisible/logs/` (currently 0 bytes)

**Exit criteria:** one complete loop end-to-end, with artifacts visible in
Notion + Telegram + git history of the target repo.

---

## Phase 2 — VPS connection hardening

The VPS link is the keystone. Today `invisible.toml` has `vps.host = ""`.

- [ ] Wire `srv982719` into `invisible.toml`
- [ ] `invisible-server` running as a systemd service on the VPS
- [ ] HTTPS via the existing wildcard cert at `theprofitplatform.com.au`
- [ ] Bearer-token auth (`INVISIBLE_SERVER_TOKEN`) stored in Infisical
- [ ] SSH ControlMaster multiplex so 6 cockpit panes reuse one connection
- [ ] Mosh fallback for flaky links (config toggle already exists)
- [ ] `invisible-vps-handoff` proven on a real running loop

**Exit criteria:** a loop started on Mac finishes on the VPS without
human intervention; the desktop dashboard reflects VPS state in real time.

---

## Phase 3 — Tauri shell migration

Replace the `pywebview + pystray` desktop wrapper (`bin/invisible-app`) with
a **Tauri** application. Tauri gives us a small native binary (~10 MB), a
Rust core, and a web frontend we can iterate on quickly.

- [ ] Scaffold `src-tauri/` with `cargo tauri init`
- [ ] React or Svelte frontend (TBD; lean toward Svelte for size)
- [ ] Tauri commands that wrap the existing CLI:
      `run_orchestrator`, `kill_run`, `list_projects`, `tail_log`, `status`
- [ ] System tray with Open / Hide / Quit (parity with pystray today)
- [ ] SSE bridge from `invisible-server` → frontend store
- [ ] Auto-update via Tauri updater (signed manifests)

**Exit criteria:** Tauri app launches, shows the dashboard, and can start /
stop / observe an orchestration loop on Mac. `bin/invisible-app` is then
marked deprecated.

---

## Phase 4 — File dashboard (three-source tree)

The defining feature of the new UI: a single sorted file panel that fuses
**local**, **GitHub**, and **VPS** filesystems.

```
┌── invisible · file panel ──────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Source ▾  Sort ▾  Filter ▾                                     │
│                                                                │
│  📁 jobslayer                                                  │
│     ├─ 📄 README.md            local · ahead 2 commits         │
│     ├─ 📄 src/main.py          github + local (same)           │
│     ├─ 📄 logs/error.log       vps only · 2.3 MB · 12m ago     │
│     ├─ 📄 .env                 local · gitignored              │
│     └─ 📁 worktrees/feat-x     local · 4 files                 │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- [ ] **Local indexer:** walks configured project paths, watches via fsnotify
- [ ] **GitHub indexer:** `gh api repos/<org>/<repo>/git/trees/HEAD?recursive=1` per project, cached
- [ ] **VPS indexer:** `find` over rsync-mirrored paths, served by `invisible-server`
- [ ] Merge engine: dedupes by relative path, annotates each entry with its source set
- [ ] Sort modes: name · size · mtime · diff-status · source
- [ ] Filter chips: `local-only` · `vps-only` · `out-of-sync` · `gitignored`
- [ ] Click → open in default editor (local), GitHub web URL (GH), `less` over ssh (VPS)
- [ ] Realtime: SSE-driven diffs so the tree updates without polling

**Exit criteria:** for any configured project, opening the file panel shows
the merged view from all three sources within 1 second, and edits on any
side update the panel within 5 seconds.

---

## Phase 5 — Embedded 6 terminals

The tmux cockpit becomes a first-class pane group inside the Tauri window.

- [ ] xterm.js × 6 panes inside the app (CSS grid layout matching today's tmux)
- [ ] Each pane spawns a backend pty via a Tauri command (or remote via ssh)
- [ ] Pane roles mirror the current cockpit:
  1. `logs`     — `invisible-log` tail
  2. `orch`     — orchestrator REPL
  3. `vps`      — ssh/mosh to `srv982719`
  4. `dashboard`— HTTP client view of `invisible-server`
  5. `gsd`      — `invisible-gsd` picker
  6. `watch`    — `invisible-watch` (project diffs)
- [ ] Resize / drag / fullscreen any pane
- [ ] Session persistence: panes survive app restart (named tmux server backend)
- [ ] Copy-on-select, OSC52 paste

**Exit criteria:** `invisible` (the tmux cockpit command) becomes a fallback
for headless use; the Tauri window is the default surface.

---

## Phase 6 — Windows packaging

Make it a real Windows app, not "WSL with extra steps".

- [ ] Cross-compile Tauri for Windows (`cargo tauri build --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`)
- [ ] Code-sign the `.msi` (EV cert decision required)
- [ ] OpenSSH client detection (Win10+ ships it; instruct otherwise)
- [ ] Path normalisation everywhere — replace `~` / `/` assumptions in `lib/config.py`
- [ ] Replace tmux-only paths with cross-platform fallback (or remove tmux dependency from the GUI flow)
- [ ] Tauri auto-updater on a Windows install
- [ ] Smoke test on a clean Windows 11 VM

**Exit criteria:** `invisible.msi` installs cleanly on a fresh Windows 11 box,
launches, connects to the VPS, and the file dashboard works.

---

## Phase 7 — Polish & v1.0

- [ ] First-run wizard (Infisical creds, VPS host, first project)
- [ ] Crash reporting (Sentry or self-hosted)
- [ ] Telemetry opt-in for usage stats
- [ ] Public landing page on `theprofitplatform.com.au/invisible`
- [ ] Demo video

**Exit criteria:** tag `v1.0.0`, publish release with `.msi` + `.dmg` + `.AppImage`.

---

## Out of scope (for now)

- Linux `.deb` / `.rpm` — AppImage only until demand
- Mobile companion app
- Multi-user / team mode (this is a single-operator tool)
- LLM provider abstraction beyond Codex + Claude
